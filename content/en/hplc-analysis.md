## Analytical HPLC Services

Our service offers flexible and rapid analysis tailored to your research needs. We provide a range of column chemistries and detection options to support your project.

### Core Capabilities

* **Column Chemistries:** We offer standard methods using **Reversed-Phase (C-18)**, **Hydrophilic Interaction (HILIC)**, and **Ion-Exchange (IEX)** columns for separating charged molecules like peptides, sugars, and organic acids.
* **Detection Systems:**
    * **Photodiode Array (PDA):** Ideal for identifying and quantifying compounds that absorb UV-Vis light. Provides full spectral data for peak purity analysis.
    * **Refractive Index (RID):** A universal detector essential for analyzing compounds with little or no UV absorbance, such as sugars and alcohols.
* **Sample QC & Solubility:** We use **nephelometry** to screen all incoming samples for particulates and precipitation in your chosen mobile phase.
