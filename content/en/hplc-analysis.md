## Analytical HPLC Services

Our early access programme offers flexible and rapid analysis tailored to your research needs. We provide a range of column chemistries and detection options to support your project.  Early access is offered in partnership with [Full Circle Labs](https://www.fullcirclelabs.bio/).

### Core Capabilities

* **Column Chemistries:** We offer standard methods using Reversed-Phase (C-18), Hydrophilic Interaction (HILIC), carbohydrate/organic-acid separations using ion-exchange and ligand-exchange approaches, and wide-pore stationary phases for peptides, proteins, and antibodies.
* **Column Library** More than 30 columns are available, covering multiple stationary phases and pore sizes. Our library is growing and we can usually match a specific separation to an appropriate stationary phase quickly for method development.
* **Detection Systems:** Photodiode array (PDA) for UV-Vis spectral detection and peak-purity checks, and refractive index (RID) for analytes with little or no UV absorbance (for example, many sugars, polyols, and solvents).
* **Sample QC & Solubility:** We use nephelometry to screen all incoming samples for particulates and precipitation in your chosen mobile phase. If an issue is detected, we will discuss options (filtration, dilution, or alternative conditions) before proceeding.

### What You Can Do Now

* Confirm intended products and quantify titres from protein expression, engineered metabolism, and enzymatic reactions, supporting strain, media, and process comparisons.
* Quantify sugars, organic acids, and other small molecules in media, fermentation samples, and extracts.
* Verify raw-material composition against specifications.
* Assess concentrations of target and trace components in environmental or agricultural samples.
* Measure targets your plate reader or in-house HPLC may not resolve, including non-UV-active analytes.

### How It Works

Get in touch through our website or email us at [hello@fieldfoundry.com](mailto:hello@fieldfoundry.com) for more information about early access.  We are happy to discuss your project, even in the early stages.

When you are ready to send samples, start by telling us what you would like to measure. We can then set up an order through your Full Circle Labs account or directly with us. Samples can be submitted using Full Circle Labsâ€™ dropboxes or by post to us, and once they reach our lab we run the analysis. Results are returned directly by email in standard formats.

Our early access services are for research use only; results from early access are not approved for regulated or diagnostic testing.
