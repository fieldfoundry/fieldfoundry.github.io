## Nephelometry & Solubility Services

We offer quantitative solubility analysis using a BMG NEPHELOStar Plus nephelometer, providing essential data for your R&D projects.

### Applications:

* **Solubility Limit Determination:** Pinpoint the exact concentration at which your compound precipitates in various conditions.
* **Buffer Optimisation:** Screen multiple buffer and solvent formulations simultaneously to find the ideal conditions for solubility and stability.
* **High-Throughput Screening:** Our 384-well plate setup is perfect for early-stage discovery projects where multiple compounds or conditions need to be tested efficiently.

### How It Works:

Our system measures turbidity by detecting scattered light as an automated injector introduces your sample to different conditions, providing a rapid and quantitative assessment of solubility.
