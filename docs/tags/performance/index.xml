Some people like fast cars. I like fast websites. But how to get to a perfect Google Lighthouse score? Let me explain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might feel that it is nearly impossible to get to a perfect 100% score. You minified your Javascript, properly scaled your images and even combined some requests, but that did not help nearly enough. The problem is: you might be looking at it from the wrong angle. I build 100% scoring websites on a daily basis, so obviously it is very well possible to get a perfect score on all your websites with little effort. I will try to explain what we want to achieve and how we can achieve that.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
